# Remotecraft for Android [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RemotecraftProject/RemotecraftApp.svg?branch=feature/search_server)](https://travis-ci.org/RemotecraftProject/RemotecraftApp) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/RemotecraftProject/RemotecraftApp/branch/feature%2Fsearch_server/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/RemotecraftProject/RemotecraftApp)
**(Work in progress)**

Connect and remotely manage your Minecraft server using cutting edge technology!

## How it works
I wrote a fake server so you don't actually need to be running the videogame itself or install extra stuff.

1. You need to run the [MockServer](https://github.com/RemotecraftProject/RemotecraftApp/blob/feature/search_server/mockserver/src/main/java/com/zireck/remotecraft/server/mock/MockServer.java) class within the mockserver module as a pure java application.
2. Run the Android app.
3. Make sure the computer running the server and the Android device running the app are both in the same WiFi network!
